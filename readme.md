This project is on display as an example of my work. Anyone can make their stuff look good with enough work, so instead I offer you this project as is to demonstrate what my work looks like when Im on a deadline and under pressure.


A summer project, a minesweeper game that I created in an afternoon as a warmup for an internship I was doing.

Further commits would include an AI functionality so that the game can play itself.
